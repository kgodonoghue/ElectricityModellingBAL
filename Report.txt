Goal 
The goal of the project was to determine what the minimum transport cost was
to transport the renewable fuel to to one central processing plant from all 
locations and then subsequently determine which of these locations would work 
best to reduce the overall transport cost when the port locatoin was included 
in the optimisation problem.


My method 
2 main functions were developed to complete the project
1. SQLconnect function which read all the data needed from the database
2. An optimisation routine called XXXX then uses this data to come up with the lowest transport cost by
	A. Get all the distances from each location to each other location and multiply by fuel volumne (Total 90)
	B. Sum the total cost for each location excluding each location on itself 
	C. Get the distance from each of the 10 locations to each of the 3 ports (30 combinations) and get the minimum value
	   The equation used will be (Each value from B + distance to port*production volumne to transport)

Assumptions Made
1. Use geometry and earth curvature does not need to be taken into acocunt for distance calculation.


My solution 
The following list of 30 potential solutions yielded the best solution which was 

Long Location      Lat Location       Long Port       Lat Port           Final Minimum Value

5.26600000e+01,   7.26000000e+00,   5.27000000e+01,    8.63000000e+00,      1.66037100e+06

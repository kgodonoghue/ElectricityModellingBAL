Goal 
The goal of the project was to determine what the minimum transport cost was to transport the renewable fuel 
from one central processing plant from all the raw material supply locations. The processed material would 
then be subsequently transported to a port for shipping. There are 9 raw material locations/processing plants 
and 3 ports and the overall goal is determine the optimal location for the processing plant and port.

My method 
Two main python functions were developed to complete the project
1. Firstly a function called “SQLconnect” was developed which reads all the data needed from the database. 
This included all the location data and production volumes.
2. An optimisation routine called “optimiseDist” then uses this data to come up with the lowest transport 
cost through the following method
A. The function gets all the distances from each location to each other location and multiplies this value by 
fuel volume (Total of  90 results obtained)
B. The function then sums the total cost for each location excluding each location on itself 
C. The final part of the function is then to get the distance from each of the 10 locations to each of the 
3 ports (30 combinations) and get the minimum overall cost value. The equation used will be 
(Each value from B + distance to port*production processed volume to transport)

Assumptions Made
1. Use geometry and earth curvature does not need to be taken into acocunt for distance calculation.
2. Direct point to point measurement will be used in the optimisation algorithm for measurement calculation 
of distance (No road consideration will be considered)


My solution 
The following list of 30 potential solutions yielded the best solution which was 

Long Location           Lat Location            Long Port                Lat Port           Final Minimum Value
